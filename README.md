# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
~~~python
a=16
print(bin(a))
~~~

## Output
![438826667-740cd71d-506b-4f8a-a0b7-5fe8554481a1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d90ea4f-689b-4e69-ad4e-5a91716980a0)

## Result
Thus ,the program is executed successfully.
